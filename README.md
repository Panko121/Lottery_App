 Lottery Application

Hello this repository contains my Lottery Application project.

To write this I used Angular in version 13.0.2. 
As additional libraries I used Angular Materials for easier styling.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or other manually chosen port. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
